  "description": [
    "Monstera Adansonii is famous because of the unique variegated foliage and leaves with holes that need more light than the ones without variegation.",
    "Variegated plants (yellow or white parts) need brighter light to survive since they have less chlorophyll than regular green plants.",
    "Monstera Adandonii Variegata is mildly toxic if ingested so you should keep an eye on your pets or children. Thanks to its aerial roots it climbs trees, totems, wood or whatever it has nearby, so you can have fun experimenting with totems or other superficies to see how this grows."

  "lightExplanation": [
    "Monstera Adansonii Variegata needs bright light because variegated plants need a little more sunlight to survive since they have less chlorophyll than regular plants.",

    "Water your monstera less often in low light conditions or in winter or its roots will rot and cause death because of over watering"
  ],
  "humidityExplanation": [
    "Monstera Adansonii Variegata does well in average humidity conditions, but it will certainly do better in slightly or highly humid rooms.",
    "The best way to increase humidity levels is to use a humidifier, avoid having windows open if you live in a dry place, and to do not use very often air conditioning or heating."
  ],
  "fertilizerExplanation": [
    "Feed your Monstera Adansonii Variegata once a week or every two weeks during the spring and summer.",
    "Don't fertilize your monstera during winter so it can rest and have plenty of energy during the growing season."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Give your Monstera Adansonii bright light.",
    "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth and gently dry to keep them clean and healthy.",
    "Don't let your Monstera remain in water.",
    "Let your Monstera trail surfaces like totems, grills or walls.",
    "Monstera roots are not the type of roots that damage walls or surfaces.",
    "Rotate your Monstera Adansonii periodically.",
