    "Scindapsus Pictus Exotica it's a must-have plant for people who like hanging plants, climbing plants, or rare varieties because it has a beautiful leaf pattern with amazing silverish color.",
    "Pothos are easy plants that are recommended for beginners because they adapt so well to temperature, light, and watering environments, so don't be afraid to water it a bit most than you should.",
    "If you have babies or pets think it twice before taking a pothos home because they are toxic if ingested. Pets have an instinct, to avoid eating toxic stuff so I don't think they will bite the plant, but take a look to see how they behave when you take it home. You can also place it out of their reach to make sure nothing bad happens.",
    "Even though this satin pothos has an exotic and unique silverish foliage, it's not so rare to find in the market given the high demand it suffers. Scindapsus Pictus Exotica is commonly confused with Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus because they both have silver patterns on their leaves even though they are easy to identify because Scindapsus Pictus Exotica leaf is completely silver except for the central part and Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus's leaf is green with silver spots."

  "lightExplanation": [
    "Scindapsus Pictus Exotica doesn't grow much in low light because the silver parts of the leaves don't capture that much light for photosynthesis, so it needs a brighter light exposure than green foliage plants.",
    "To achieve exposure to bright light, Scindapsus Pictus must be placed on east, south, or west-facing windows always filtering the direct sunlight or placing it a few feet inside. Keep your pothos in bright light to make their colors and contrast more vibrant.",
    "Even though variegated or silverish pothos can grow perfectly in north-facing windows, having it placed there won't make the plant have a vibrant color contrast or grow fast because the light that will receive is less"
  ],
  "waterExplanation": [
    "Pothos are plants recommended for beginners because they are easy to take care of thanks to their ability to adapt to almost any environment, not being watering an exception.",
    "Water your Scindapsus Pictus at least once per week as a general rule. You can tell if your pothos needs water if the top 2 inches are dry so you can keep the soil moist or either its leaves start to curl in order to keep moisture.",
    "Avoid killing your pothos by over-watering and root rot by using well-draining soil and using porous pots like terracotta so they can absorb humidity from the soil.",
    "You should reduce the frequency of watering during winter because sunlight is lighter which means that plants receive less light so their photosynthesis is slowed down. This means the water will remain longer in the soil and can cause over-watering and root-rot"
  ],
  "humidityExplanation": [
    "Scindapsus Pictus Exotica does well in average room humidity, so you don't really need to inrease the humidity of your place unless you live in a dry weather or you use artificial heat that tends to dry the environment.",
    "As a general rule, pothos love humid spaces and that's why bathrooms perfect for them. To increase the humidity else you can group y our plants and/or use a humidifier.",
    "Even though some people like misting the leaves of the plants in order to increase the humidity, it's not a recommended practice because it can make pests appear or thin leaves to get burned."
  ],
  "fertilizerExplanation": [
    "Fertilize your Scindapsus Pictus every 2 weeks during the growing season to maximize its growth, but it's not necessary because it's a fast growing plant.",
    "It's always mandatory to either repot the plant every 2 years, or fertilize it, so we can provide new macro and micro nutrients to the soil."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth and gently dry to keep them clean and healthy.",
    "The leaves tend to face towards the way of light, so rotate your plant on a regular basis.",
    "If you want to control the shape of the plant, use pruners or scissors with a sharp blade.",
    "Use a totem to make your pothos climb.",
    "Scindapsus Pictus Exotica is an ideal plant for a bright bathroom.",
    "All pothos look amazing hanging somewhere, try it!"
