  "description": [
    "Epipremnum Aureum Neon is a variety of pothos well known for its distinctive lime color. It is an easy plant recommended for beginners because it thrives in low light conditions and does not require much maintenance, although its growth is slowed down.",
    "The leaves of the pothos remind us of a heart. Your pets and you have to be careful because it causes irritation if ingested. Pothos are so common because you can do very nice projects such as hanging baskets or green walls because they are climbing plants.",
    "All pothos are purifying plants so they are especially recommended for offices, bathrooms and bedrooms."

    "Epipremnum Aureum Neon is a plant that grows very quickly with the right amount of light. It prefers bright light but not direct light, although it tolerates low light conditions.",
    "Neon Pothos leaves will turn darker in low light conditions.",
    "In case of having this plant hanging somewhere, make sure the sun still hits the top of it, or lots of leaves will die."
  ],
  "waterExplanation": [
    "Pothos are plants that like moist but not soggy soil, so water you pothos every time the top inch is dry.",
    "In winter time, because sun doesn't hit that hard and because temperatures are lower, you might reduce your watering.",
    "If you're using a terracotta pot, you'll have to water your Neon Pothos more often because porous materials absorb humidity."
  ],
  "humidityExplanation": [
    "Epipremnum Aureum Neon does okay in average room humidity, but feel free to increase it if you want.",
    "An easy way to increase humidity is to group your plants, mist the leaves or place a container with water near the plant so it evaporates."
  ],
  "fertilizerExplanation": [
    "As a pothos plant, it doesn't require much fertilizer but, in case you prefer to feed your Neon Pothos, do it every 2 weeks spring through fall with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. In winter, you could feed it monthly."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Mist the leaves to increase humidity.",
    "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth and gently dry to keep them clean and healthy.",
    "The leaves tend to face towards the way of light, so rotate your plant on a regular basis.",
    "If you want to control the shape of the plant, use pruners or scissors with a sharp blade.",
    "Use a totem to make your pothos climb.",
    "Epipremnum Aureum Neon is an ideal plant for a bright bathroom.",
    "All pothos look amazing hanging somewhere, try it!"
