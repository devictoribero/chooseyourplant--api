  "description": [
    "Zamioculca Zamiifolia is a plant native to Zanzibar, Kenya, and East Africa, famous for its attractive bright foliage and easy care. Commonly known as the ZZ plant, it is a recommended plant for beginners because it does not require much maintenance.",
    "Zamioculcas are recommended plants for travelers because they are drought tolerant thanks to their potato-shaped rhizome that allows them to store water and survive several days without water.",
    "On the other hand, zamioculcas adapt incredibly well to any light conditions (they are famous for being the best plants for low light conditions). That is why many people use them as office plants and everyone should have one at home. In addition, it is a purifying plant so it helps keep environments in a healthy state.",
    "Zamioculca Zamiifolia can grow up to 38 inches given the good growing conditions. Keep in mind that it is a toxic plant if ingested, so take extreme precautions in case you have pets or children nearby."

  "lightExplanation": [
    "Zamioculcas are plants famous for being the plant that best adapts to low light conditions, although it is not the best for them. Remember that plants need light to photosynthesize and live, so be sure not to place your plant in too dark or lightless conditions.",
    "Zamioculca zamiifolia prefers bright, indirect light and does well in a bit of direct, non-intense sunlight such as the early morning sun for about an hour. The ZZ plant, like any other plant, has a slower metabolism in low light conditions and therefore grows more slowly.",
    "I like to place my ZZ plants next to a north-facing window so it can get direct morning sunlight or a few feet far from east, south or west-facing window because the sun it's too strong."
  ],
  "waterExplanation": [
    "The ZZ plant is drought tolerant. Therefore, it doesn't need a lot of water because it grows from thick, round, potato-like tuberous rhizomes that store water. It also has thick roots that help it hold water for a long time.",
    "Zamioculca is a water sensitive plant. Water it thoroughly when the entire substrate has dried out which will be usually once every 3-4 weeks. Soaked soil will cause rhizomes to rot, so pay attention to the amount of water you use and the type of soil you use.",
    "Watering is directly related to how much light the plant needs, the soil, and the temperature, so watering will be different in summer than winter.",
    "Yellow foliage and smooth stems are also a sign of too much water. Although the ZZ plant will tolerate dry soil, it is likely to drop its leaves if it is left too dry, too long."
  ],
  "humidityExplanation": [
    "Zamioculca is fine with average home humidity because it can tolerate slightly dry air."
  ],
  "fertilizerExplanation": [
    "Fertilize ZZ plant once every six months or so with a general-purpose fertilizer labeled for use on houseplants. You can also fertilize more frequently if you want your plant to grow larger and faster."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Lhe let soil of your Zamioculca dry out completely before watering it.",
    "Propagate it only when it's outgrowing its current home.",
    "Don't take pots that outsize the plant because It likes to be tight.",
    "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth and gently dry to keep them clean and healthy.",
    "Don't place your zz plant in the sun for long periods, nor afternoon sun.",
    "ZZ plant is toxic if ingested, so pay attention to your pets",
    "Place your zamioculca in the bedrooms or living room because it's an air purifier plant."
