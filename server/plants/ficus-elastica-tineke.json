    "The Ficus elastica Tineke also known as variegated rubber tree or Ficus elastica Variegata, is a popular variety of ficus known for its beautiful big and watercolor variegated foliage that looks similar to <a href='/ficus-elastica-burgundy'>Ficus Elastica Burgundy</a> that everyone wants to have in the living room.",
    "Apart from its gorgeous and unique foliage, Ficus Tineke is well-known for being a plant recommended plants for beginners because it's a low-maintenance plant. Ficus elastica is a drought-tolerant (but not so much) and can handle direct sunlight for a while thanks to its thick and shiny leaves.",
    "Ficus elastica is quite a versatile plant when it comes to light requirements, but all variegates plants will lose their variegation if placed in low light spots.",
    "oh, I almost forget! Over time, this amazing Ficus Elastica Variegata can grow up to 10 inches as a houseplant."

  "lightExplanation": [
    "The Ficus Elastica Tineke Tree will grow best with consistent, bright, filtered light even though it can handle small periods of direct sunlight thanks to its thick leaves.",
    "As a general rule, variegated plants need way more light than regular plants and grow slower because they have less chlorophyll on their leaves which means they are not able to capture the same amount of light, so their photosynthesis will be slower.",
    "Place your Ficus Elastica Tineke next to east and south-facing windows to give it the brightest filtered light possible. The afternoon sun is harsh, so if you can't filter the light, place it a few feet far from the window."
  ],
  "waterExplanation": [
    "Rubber plants are relatively low-maintenance house plants, but it's important to take care not to overwater them. If the roots sit in water, they can suffer from root rot and fungus gnats can become an issue.",
    "Water your Ficus Elastica Tineke every time half of the soil approximately has dried out and make sure the pot has a hole or many where the water can escape through.",
    "The frequency of watering a plant depends on the temperature of the weather, the light the plant is exposed to and the size of the pot as well of how well the soil drains.",
    "The indoor ficus will still seek watering according to the natural growing season. Water your plant more during the summer months and scale back during the winter months."
  ],
  "humidityExplanation": [
    "Your Ficus Tineke will do great in average household humidity and adapts well to almost any environment, so it doesn't require you to increase the humidity of your place even though it would like it.",
    "In the case of having a humidifier because of other plants, it will benefit your Ficus Elastica, but I don't recommend buying a humidifier only because you got this plant, because it doesn't really need it."
  ],
  "fertilizerExplanation": [
    "For best results, feed your Ficus Elastica Variegata once a month from spring through summer with a general houseplant fertilizer diluted to half the recommended strength."
