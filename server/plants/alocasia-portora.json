  "description": [
    "Alocasia Portora is one of the largest alocasias that you can find and that is why it is commonly used in outdoor spaces although it has begun to be commercialized for large and bright spaces.",
    "This impressive alocasia is commonly known as elephant ear because of the shape of its leaves. Most alocasias are medium size, but unlike those, the Alocasia Portora can grow up to 4-5ft in good conditions such as abundant water, a substrate rich in organic matter, high humidity, and above all a lot of bright light even direct sunlight.",
    "A curious fact is that Alocasia Portora is really an alocasia, unlike Alocasia Amazonica or other plants commonly known as alocasias that are actually colocasia. The main difference between alocasia vs colocasia is that the leaves of the alocasia point upwards, while the leaves of the colocasia are horizontal or point downwards."
