  "description": [
    "Alocasia Melo is an exotic plant native to the Southeast Asian forests, specifically Indonesia, which tends to grow in rocky terrain, unlike other alocasias. This alocasia is considered a small plant because although in nature it can grow up to 23 inches in height, as a houseplant it is not usual, and does not exceed 15 inches approximately.",
    "Alocasia Melo is commonly known as Alocasia Rugosa for its unique foliage. Its leaves are green, large, and thick with a rough texture that makes it look like an artificial plant. Alocasias grow in tropical forests in the shade of higher vegetation, which is why it should not be given direct sunlight.",
    "If you have animals or children, you must take extreme precautions because alocasias are toxic plants when ingested."
