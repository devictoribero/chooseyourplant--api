  "description": [
    "Zamioculca Zamiifolia Raven was born in the summer of 2017. It is a succulent plant that has attractive dark glossy foliage due to its high concentration of chlorophyll. In fact, is one of the few plants that its leaves are almost black.",
    "Given its waxy leaves that look artificial and the large rhizome that reminds us of a potato, zamioculcas can store water giving them the capacity to survive for long periods of time without water. This makes ZZ plant one of the best drought-tolerant plants on earth. In addition, having the ability to retain water, makes it a sensitive plant, as it is easy for its roots to rot."

  "waterExplanation": [
    "ZZ plant grow from thick, round tuberous rhizomes. These store water as do the thick, fleshy roots & somewhat spongy stems. Water your Zamioculca thoroughly but allow the top 2 inches (5 cm) of soil to dry out between waterings.",
    "Soggy soil will cause the rhizomes to rot so pay attention either how much water you use and the type of soil you use.",
    "Yellow foliage and soft stems are also a sign of too much water. Although ZZ plant will tolerate dry soil, it will likely drop its leaves if left too dry, too long."
