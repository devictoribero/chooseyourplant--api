  "description": [
    "Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus is an easy plant originally from Asia recommended to people who like hanging plants, climbing plants, or exotic varieties because it has a beautiful silver color pattern. Place your pothos far from pets and children because they are poisonous if ingested.",
    "Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus is commonly confused with Scindapsus Pictus Exotica because they both have silver patterns on their leaves. You can identify Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus because its leaf has a higher color contrast because its variegation appears more sparse (green with silver spots) and Scindapsus Pictus Exotica's leaf curl at the edges and is completely silver except for the central part."

  "lightExplanation": [
    "Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus survives in low light conditions even though you would think it's not possible because it has silver spots on its leaves that don't absorb the same amount of light than regular green leaves.",
    "To give to your pothos a bright indirect light consider placing it in a south-facing window to make it grow fast, but avoid the direct sunlight."
  ],
  "waterExplanation": [
    "Even though pothos aren't drought tolerant plants, they are not so picky plants when it comes to watering which makes them good plants for beginners. Water your Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus every time the top inch of the soil is dry which will be about once a week.",
    "In winter, water it less often to avoid killing by root rot."
  ],
  "humidityExplanation": [
    "Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus does okay in average room humidity but it will love if there's high humidity. Bright bathrooms are a good place for your pothos."
  ],
  "fertilizerExplanation": [
    "Pothos are fast groers and don't need much fertilizer but you can fertilize your Scindapsus Pictus twice a month during the growing season."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth and gently dry to keep them clean and healthy.",
    "The leaves tend to face towards the way of light, so rotate your plant on a regular basis.",
    "If you want to control the shape of the plant, use pruners or scissors with a sharp blade.",
    "Use a totem to make your pothos climb.",
    "Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus is an ideal plant for a bright bathroom.",
    "All pothos look amazing hanging somewhere, try it!"
