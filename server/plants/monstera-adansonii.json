  "description": [
    "Monstera Adansonii it's a trailing tropical plant with a wild look thanks to its variegated foliage, leaves with holes, and aerial roots that make it a rare specimen.",
    "Variegated plants (yellow or white parts) are exotic plants that can be natural or artificially generated by crossing plants, that need brighter light to survive since they have less chlorophyll than regular green plants.",
    "Monstera Adansonii is mildly toxic if ingested so you should keep an eye on your pets or children. It doesn't mean you can't have them, but when adding a monstera to your collection, pay close attention for a week or two, to see how your pets or children react to it. If the monstera caught their attention and you are not sure if they will bite it, make sure to place it far from them.",
    "As well as pothos, one of the biggest characteristics of monsteras is its aerial roots that they use to hold themselves on trees, walls, totems, or other superficies in order to reach brighter light and keep growing."

  "lightExplanation": [
    "Monstera Adansonii can grow about anywhere in your home because it tolerates low light. In fact, monsteras grow under the coverage of trees in the wild! In low light conditions you may notice leggy growth as a result.",
    "To see Monstera Adansonii growing best and fast, place it in a bright but indirect spot. Monsteras use their aerial roots to climb through totems, wood and similar looking for the brightest spot.",
    "If you place your monstera in a north-facing window, keep it next to the glass and It's okay if the direct sun hits the leaves as far as it's not for long, but water it frequently.",
    "On the other hand, if you place it in a south or west-facing windows, you either diffuse the sunlight or you'll have to place your monstera a few feet far from the window to avoid direct sun."
  ],
  "waterExplanation": [
    "Water your Monstera Adansonii every time the first 2-3 inches of soil is dry because it loves wet soil. You'll find yourself watering it once or twice a week depending on how well the soil drains and the amount of light it receives.",
    "A plant that is in a east or south-facing window will need more water than a plant that is in a window facing north. If you mixed your soil with organic matter, it will keep humidity better."
  ],
  "humidityExplanation": [
    "Monstera Adansonii are humidity lovers but they do well in average room humidity, but if you want to give it a special treat, gently mist it once a week. It’s best to mist your Monstera in the morning so the water has plenty of time to evaporate before the evening."
  ],
  "fertilizerExplanation": [
    "For best results, feed your Monstera Adansonii once a month throughout the spring and summer and give it a rest during the winter so it can save energy for next growing season."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth and gently dry to keep them clean and healthy.",
    "A well-draining soil is a must. A mix of universal soil, cactus soil, and perlite is the best.",
    "Monstera Adansonii roots are not the type of roots that damage walls or surfaces.",
    "Rotate your Monstera Adansonii periodically because it's leaves go towards light."
