    "description": [
      "Alocasia Amazonica is a hybrid plant of Alocasia Longiloba and Alocasia Sanderiana that are native to Asia although this one is from America.",
      "This plant commonly called Alocasia Polly is known as African Mask or Elephant Ear for its incredible color, shape, and resistance of its foliage that is hard, rub-resistant, and arrow-shaped. Furthermore, the thin the stems make the leaves to look bigger.",
      "Alocasias are tropical plants that like hot environments, with high humidity and therefore, they grow in humid soil and full of organic matter. In nature, they grow in the shade of tall trees that are filtered by the sun's rays.",
      "If you're planning to have alocasias at home, be careful if you have children or animals because all alocasias are considered moderately toxic plants if ingested"

    "water": "frequent",
    "humidity": "high",
    "fertilizer": "moderate",
    "lightExplanation": [
      "Alocasia Amazonica needs bright light to grow healthy and to keep its beautiful intense foliage. In fact, Alocasia Polly can handle direct sunlight for a while if it's not super intense, but be careful because the leaves will burn easily.",
      "It's best to situate your Alocasia Amazonica in a location that receives bright light to make alocasia foliage looks great and retains its deep green coloring. In fact, those living in an area where the temperatures and light conditions are not intense can place it in a location that receives direct sunlight.",
      "When Alocasia Amazonica doesn't get enough light it will lose color contrast even on its veins and will eventually, die. So its colors are a good light indication."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "In nature, the parents of Alocasia Amazonica grow near sources of water and organic matter, making their roots always wet. For this reason, when having alocasias as houseplants we must water them often to keep their substrate moist at all times.",
      "Alocasias need to be watered frequently. You should water your alocasia every time the upper part of the soil is dry. I recommend you have a well-draining soil combined with organic matter to keep the humidity but not the water, or otherwise, the plant will die because its roots will run out of oxygen or its roots will rot.",
      "Water your Alocasia Amazonica less frequently during winter because the soil takes longer to dry."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Alocasia Amazonica needs moderate to high humidity levels are required, ideally greater than 50% humidity. If the humidity is below those levels, its leave will start to turn yellow and will die."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "Fertilize your Alocasia Amazonica every 2-4 weeks during the growing season with a balanced, water soluble fertilizer.",
      "Dilute to half strength, particularly in spring and autumn. There is no need to fertilize during the winter. Flush the potting mix every 2-3 months."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "The best place for your Alocasia Amazonica is a bright bathroom.",
      "Avoid placing your alocasia plant near heating or cooling vents."

      "This impressive alocasia is commonly known as elephant ear because of the shape of its leaves. Most alocasias are medium size, but unlike those, the Alocasia Portora can grow up to 4-5ft in good conditions such as abundant water, a substrate rich in organic matter, high humidity, and above all a lot of bright light even direct sunlight.",
      "A curious fact is that Alocasia Portora is really an alocasia, unlike Alocasia Amazonica or other plants commonly known as alocasias that are actually colocasia. The main difference between alocasia vs colocasia is that the leaves of the alocasia point upwards, while the leaves of the colocasia are horizontal or point downwards."

    "description": [
      "Alocasia Melo is an exotic plant native to the Southeast Asian forests, specifically Indonesia, which tends to grow in rocky terrain, unlike other alocasias. This alocasia is considered a small plant because although in nature it can grow up to 23 inches in height, as a houseplant it is not usual, and does not exceed 15 inches approximately.",
      "Alocasia Melo is commonly known as Alocasia Rugosa for its unique foliage. Its leaves are green, large, and thick with a rough texture that makes it look like an artificial plant. Alocasias grow in tropical forests in the shade of higher vegetation, which is why it should not be given direct sunlight.",
      "If you have animals or children, you must take extreme precautions because alocasias are toxic plants when ingested."

    "lightExplanation": [
      "Alocasia Rugosa is a plant that should not receive direct sunlight despite having thick leaves. In its natural habitat, direct sunlight is filtered by trees and plants that are taller than it.",
      "Indirect and bright light is the best condition for Alocasia Melo to grow strong and healthy because it is the closest thing to its natural habitat. Avoid low light conditions."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Alocasia Melo grows around the stones which means that they donâ€™t like much water to reach their roots. well-draining soil is a must.",
      "Water the plant moderately after the upper 2 inches of the soil gets dry. In warm days, water your alocasia every two to three days. However, the water requirement of the majority of plants decreased in the winter.",
      "Just like the majority of Alocasias, these plants donâ€™t tolerate wet feet. Thus, avoid overwatering and never let the oil get soggy."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "High humidity is a must when growing an alocasia. The required humidity for Alocasia Melo is about 75%.",
      "In dry environments, consider adding a humidifier in the surroundings. Moreover, you can try mild misting, pebble-water tray under the pot, or plant grouping."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "Give a monthly dose of common NPK fertilizer or some domestic houseplant mix in the growing season. You can simply dilute the fertilizer or use 1/3rd to half of the stated dose.",
      "Nevertheless, Alocasias will not require any added nutrition in fall and winter."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Use well-draining soil because Alocasia Rugosa grows in rocky terrain.",
      "Make sure you have high humidity before having an Alocasia or it will die.",
      "You can increase your humidity with a humidifier and grouping plants",
      "Bathrooms are good spots for alocasias because of the high humidity",
      "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust.",
      "Don't let direct sunlight hit the plant."

      "Alocasia Stingray is an exotic and rare plant that is easy to keep alive as it does not require excessive care. Although it is an easy plant, it is not a recommended plant for beginners as it is sensitive to temperature and humidity.",
      "This elephant ear is becoming popular and is famous for its large leaf with a unique shape that has a long upturned tail that reminds us of a stingray. Like some other alocasias, it needs bright indirect light (south or west-facing windows are best as long as it is indirect light) and loves damp, well-drained soil mixed with organic matter as these are the characteristics of its natural habitat.",
      "Alocasia Stingray looks similar to differentiate Alocasia Zebrina because they both have a deep green color on the leaves and a similar pattern and color on the stem.",
      "Although their similarities, It is easy to differ Alocasia Stingray of Alocasia Zebrina by the shape of the leaves. Alocasia Stingray leaves are rounder and have a pointed finish, while Alocasia Zebrina leaves are triangular with an arrow shape.",
      "Alocasia is toxic if ingested, so they are not plants safe for cats, dogs neither children. With that being said, it doesn't mean you can't get one. Personally, I have a cat and we have plenty of plants that are toxic if ingested, but th does not pay attention to them. If he does, you might want to place these plants wherever he can't reach them."

      "Alocasia Stingray is a tropical plant that loves warm and humid environments although it can survive in slightly different conditions. Alocasia Stingray loves bright light but it is not necessary",
      "The best place to have our Alocasia Stingray is an illuminated west, south, or east-faced window as long as we filter the sunlight, or we place it a few feet far from the window.",
      "You can let your Alocasia Stingray receive direct sunlight for an hour or so as long it is not very intense, that's why people like to give it morning sun-light in an east-facing window."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Water your Alocasia Stingray until water runs out of the drain holes every time you see that the top 2 inches of the soil are dry.",
      "It's important to check the soil of alocasias frequently because they like moist substrate. With this in mind, you'll approximately water your Alocasia Stingray about once or twice a week.",
      "In nature, alocasias grow in soils with a lot of organic matter and high humidity which makes the soil never dry out.",
      "To keep an Alocasia Stingray happy you must plant it in a substrate that drains very well because it is a plant that you will often water. If a well-draining substrate is not used, it is easy to water the substrate often when it is soaked and its fine roots rot."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Alocasias love bright bathrooms because they like slightly higher humidity levels than many other plants. You may need to raise the humidity levels in a room artificially using a humidifier or it will eventually die."

      "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth and gently dry to keep them clean and healthy.",

    "waterExplanation": [
      "At first, watering your plant will be difficult until you get used to it. Aspidistra needs a soil that is not too dry nor soaked because in nature it receives water occasionally. You'll have to keep the soil moist but not soggy.",
      "Water your Aspidistra Elatior often but make sure the soil is almost completely dry before pouring water again. If you ever forgot to give it water, don't worry because the Cast Iron Plant is drought-tolerant.",
      "The amount of water is directly related to the amount of light it receives, so in low light conditions and in winter you'll have to just water it a bit or its roots will rot and cause death."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Aspidistra does handle dry air and low humidity but does best with some air moisture. So it's easy to combine Aspidistra with other plants."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "Fertilize your aspidistra once a year if it is in low light conditions and once every three months otherwise. Do not fertilize it in winter"
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Don't place your Aspidistra Elatior in direct sunlight.",
      "Water your Cast Iron Plant only when its soil has dried almost completely.",
      "Aspidistra Elatior are good office plants because they survive low light conditions even artificial.",
      "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust."

      "Epipremnum Aureum Glacier is a small pothos variety in the market and it has a nice green and white contrast on their small leaves. Glacier Pothos is commonly confused with Pearls and Jade Pothos and Njoy Pothos although you can differentiate your Glacier because it tends to have more silvery-gray mottling/streaking than others and smaller leaves.",
      "Epipremnum Aureum Glacier is a hardy climbing plant highly recommended for beginners and people who travel thanks to the fact that it is a plant that adapts very well to many environments and conditions.",
      "Pothos is a plant that can grow in not so bright places or even artificial conditions (even though it requires a little bit more light than other pothos because of the variegations). Pothos are not sensitive to water, so it can last a few days more, although it is not recommended to have it for long periods without watering it.",
      "Pothos are toxic plants if ingested, so you should increase precautions if you have cats, dogs or babies. On the other hand, it is a very beautiful and versatile climbing plant that is commonly used as a hanging plant next to the windows, in big spaces or in the balconies."

    "lightExplanation": [
      "Epipremnum Aureum Glacier requires more light than other pothos since in low light conditions it doesn't grow much because the white parts of the leaves don't capture light for photosynthesis. The best condition for your Glacier Pothos is a moderate or bright light.",
      "Glacier Pothos will be fine in a north-facing window, but we will have to place it a few feet inside if our window is facing south or west because the sun is way more intense.",
      "In case you have a Glacier Pothos as a hanging plant, make sure that the light reaches the top of the plant and not just the leaves that are hanging."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Having a moist substrate is one of the ideal conditions for a Glacier Pothos, but it does not mean that it is necessary. Therefore, it is recommended to water your Epipremnum Aureum Glacier when you see that the first two inches of the substrate are dry (it is usually at least once a week), so you will have a fairly moist substrate and avoid overwatering.",
      "It is very easy to see when you have to water your pothos because their leaves curl to maintain the humidity they have and thus optimize resources.",
      "If you are a person who likes to water plants, it is recommended to use a pot of a porous material such as terracotta because it absorbs moisture and it is more difficult for roots to rot."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Epipremnum Aureum Glacier are low maintenance plants recommended for beginners that easily adapt to almost all kinds of conditions.",
      "Pothos don't need any kind of care regarding humidity. As tropical plants, they prefer humid environments and that is why they are recommended plants for the bathroom, but the average humidity of any room is good for them.",
      "Pothos will not suffer if we have a slightly dry environment because their leaves are not thin."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "It is recommended to fertilize your Glacier Pothos once every 1-2 weeks. Pothos are one of the fastest growing plants and when we provide them with fertilizer and bright light they grow like demons, although they don't need it.",
      "Fertilize your pothos if you have it as a hanging plant or climbing on some wall or totem."

      "Make sure your pothos doesn't receive direct sunlight if it's on a south or east-facing window.",

      "Pothos is one of the easiest and best indoor plants that purify the air with its green heart-shaped foliage. It removes chemicals from the air such as formaldehyde, trichloroethene, toluene, xylene, and benzene and is recommended for living rooms, bedrooms and offices.",
      "It's a fast-growing plant climbs through trees and surfaces to grow healthier and longer thanks to its aerial roots.",

      "Epipremnum Aureum Jade tolerates low light conditions but its growth will be slowed down. If you want to see your Jade pothos growing fast and healthy give it as much bright light as possible by placing it next to a south or east-facing window.",
      "Make sure your jade pothos is not under direct sunlight for long periods of time or it will burn its leaves, so if you place it in porches or next to a sunny window, make sure to filter the light most of the time."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Water your Jade pothos every time the top inch is dried, but don't over water it because their roots rot easily. To avoid over watering you can use terracotta or porous materials.",
      "The best practice for watering a pothos is to do it slowly so water doesn't run down the outside of the root ball and making sure the central part is watered."

      "Epipremnum Aureum Jade does okay in average room humidity (around 40% relative humidity) or higher. Brown leaves could be an indicator of low humidity."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "You can use diluted regular houseplant fertilizer once a month or during the growing season of spring through early fall. Too much plant food causes excess salt build up in the soil that can result in leaf burn."

      "The Ficus elastica Tineke also known as variegated rubber tree or Ficus elastica Variegata, is a popular variety of ficus known for its beautiful big and watercolor variegated foliage that looks similar to <a href='/ficus-elastica-burgundy'>Ficus Elastica Burgundy</a> that everyone wants to have in the living room.",
      "Apart from its gorgeous and unique foliage, Ficus Tineke is well-known for being a plant recommended plants for beginners because it's a low-maintenance plant. Ficus elastica is a drought-tolerant (but not so much) and can handle direct sunlight for a while thanks to its thick and shiny leaves.",
      "Ficus elastica is quite a versatile plant when it comes to light requirements, but all variegates plants will lose their variegation if placed in low light spots.",
      "oh, I almost forget! Over time, this amazing Ficus Elastica Variegata can grow up to 10 inches as a houseplant."

    "lightExplanation": [
      "The Ficus Elastica Tineke Tree will grow best with consistent, bright, filtered light even though it can handle small periods of direct sunlight thanks to its thick leaves.",
      "As a general rule, variegated plants need way more light than regular plants and grow slower because they have less chlorophyll on their leaves which means they are not able to capture the same amount of light, so their photosynthesis will be slower.",
      "Place your Ficus Elastica Tineke next to east and south-facing windows to give it the brightest filtered light possible. The afternoon sun is harsh, so if you can't filter the light, place it a few feet far from the window."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Rubber plants are relatively low-maintenance house plants, but it's important to take care not to overwater them. If the roots sit in water, they can suffer from root rot and fungus gnats can become an issue.",
      "Water your Ficus Elastica Tineke every time half of the soil approximately has dried out and make sure the pot has a hole or many where the water can escape through.",
      "The frequency of watering a plant depends on the temperature of the weather, the light the plant is exposed to and the size of the pot as well of how well the soil drains.",
      "The indoor ficus will still seek watering according to the natural growing season. Water your plant more during the summer months and scale back during the winter months."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Your Ficus Tineke will do great in average household humidity and adapts well to almost any environment, so it doesn't require you to increase the humidity of your place even though it would like it.",
      "In the case of having a humidifier because of other plants, it will benefit your Ficus Elastica, but I don't recommend buying a humidifier only because you got this plant, because it doesn't really need it."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "For best results, feed your Ficus Elastica Variegata once a month from spring through summer with a general houseplant fertilizer diluted to half the recommended strength."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Place it next to an east or south-facing window with filtered light or a few feet inside",

    "description": [
      "Ficus Lyrata commonly known as Fiddle Leaf Fig is a ficus that has become very popular in recent years thanks to how elegant and beautiful it is, the large size of its leaves, and how easy it is to take care of it.",
      "The ficus Lyrata is a tree native to West Africa that grows in the rain forest and, like all plants, will increase in size as we give it more room to grow, reaching up to 10 meters. Its leaves are a uniform green color, soft and can measure up to 8 inches.",
      "Fiddle Leaf Fig is a little more delicate than Ficus Elastica because it needs more light, is more sensitive to water, and is used to losing leaves.",
      "If you have pets or small children be careful because it is toxic when ingested. That does not mean that you cannot have it, but it does mean that you must exercise extreme caution or attention."

    "light": ["moderate", "bright"],
    "water": "often",
    "humidity": "average",
    "fertilizer": "moderate",
    "lightExplanation": [
      "Ficus Lyrata grows in a range of light conditions, from full sun to partial shade, but will not do well in deep shade, so avoid low-light conditions.",
      "Think that in the wild it receives plenty of direct sunlight, so as far as it has enough soil and space to grow, it will en enough. If you have your Fiddle Leaf Fig indoors, it's recommended to filter the light because the space to grow is limited, so it's easy that the leaves get burned out.",
      "Rotation is also key! You will quickly notice your Lyrata will tend to bend and reach towards the light. Rotate the plant so it needs to bend the opposite way. This will ensure it grows tall and straight."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Like all plants, your Ficus Lyrata requires water to survive. However, this tree is native to Africa, so it doesn't need the same amount of water as an Amazon tree. Too much water will kill it.",
      "The best practice is to stick your fingers a few inches into the ground to see how dry or wet it is. If the soil is dry a few inches below, go ahead and water your Lyrata with room temperature water. If you feel the soil is wet, wait to water until the soil is dry because it's better to underwatering than overwatering",
      "Do not allow your Lyrata to remain in the water for more than a day or two. New growth turns black and green leaves fall off from overwatering. Leaves become brown and crunchy, drop off, and may turn yellow when the plant needs water."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Ficus Lyrata does okay in average room humidity and doesn't need a high humidity. In case you live in a dry zone, try to elevate your humidity to 40-50% which is the average worldwide.",
      "You can increase the humidity by grouping plants, using a humidifier or placing your plant into a bathroom."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "The safest and easiest fertilizer for your Ficus Lyrata is to use is a good liquid fertilizer. Youâ€™ll want to dilute the fertilizer to avoid overfeeding your plant and water it once every two weeks at most with that dilution.",
      "Don't feed your ficus in the winter, so it can rest and save energy for the next growing season"
    ],
    "tips": [
      "You must rotate periodically your Ficus Lyrata if placed indoors.",
      "You should water your Fiddle Leaf Fig If the leaves are crispy.",
      "You are overwatering it if new growth turns black or green leaves fall off.",
      "Wipe the leaves with a damp cloth and gently dry to keep them clean and healthy.",
      "You can trim some leaves of your ficus to make it look a rounded small tree.",
      "Pay attention to your pets, because Fiddle Leaf Fig is toxic if ingested."

      "Maranta leuconeura var. kerchoveana is an evergreen plant with patterned leaves originally from Brazil Rainforests that is kept as a house plant for its attractive foliage.",
      "Also commonly known by the name prayer plant because its leaves remind us to two hands praying because its leaves fold upward at night.",
      "Maranta Leuconeura grows approx. up to 30-40cm and it gets bushy because it grows horizontally. The leaves of Maranta Leuconeura Kerchoveana are oval in shape, colored green-grey, with darker green to brown splashes across the surface. On the other hand, these colors are not visible from the back, not even the vein arrangement.",
      "Maranta Leuconeura is usually placed in the corners of furniture or in a hanging basket because it looks great with a cascade look.",

    "waterExplanation": [
      "In spring through fall, water your Maranta regularly with tepid water so the soil stays moist. Donâ€™t use hard water as these plants are sensitive to fluoride in tap water, which can cause brown leaf tips.",
      "Water plentifully as much as necessary to keep the soil thoroughly moist in the active growing period and make sure you use a well-draining soil so it doesn't get soggy. Empty the plant saucers after watering, to avoid that stagnant water could damage the roots.",
      "During the winter and in low-light conditions water sparingly, allowing the top half of the soil to dry out between waterings.",
      "Yellow-pigmented, spotted, and curled leaves usually indicate under-watering, while limp stems are usually a sign of over-watering, which is most common in winter."

      "Variegated plants (yellow or white parts) need brighter light to survive since they have less chlorophyll than regular green plants.",
      "Monstera Adandonii Variegata is mildly toxic if ingested so you should keep an eye on your pets or children. Thanks to its aerial roots it climbs trees, totems, wood or whatever it has nearby, so you can have fun experimenting with totems or other superficies to see how this grows."

    "waterExplanation": [
      "Water your Monstera Adansonii Variegata thoroughly once per week until water leaves the drainage hole. If you don't know how to keep the soil moist water your monstera when the 2 top inch of the soil is dry.",
      "How often we water our plants is directly related to other factors such as temperature or light, but you need to water your monstera periodically to make it grow best because plants kind of get used to that.",
      "Water your monstera less often in low light conditions or in winter or its roots will rot and cause death because of over watering"

    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Monstera Adansonii Variegata does well in average humidity conditions, but it will certainly do better in slightly or highly humid rooms.",
      "The best way to increase humidity levels is to use a humidifier, avoid having windows open if you live in a dry place, and to do not use very often air conditioning or heating."

If the monstera caught their attention and you are not sure if they will bite it, make sure to place it far from them.",

      "Monstera Adansonii are humidity lovers but they do well in average room humidity, but if you want to give it a special treat, gently mist it once a week. Itâ€™s best to mist your Monstera in the morning so the water has plenty of time to evaporate before the evening."

      "The leaves of the Monstera Sp. Peru are somewhat wider, and look rounder, and differ from the leaves of Monstera Pinnatipartita that are more elongated.",
      "Monsteras are plants that are not especially difficult for beginners. Make sure your monstera doesn't get more than 30min of direct sunlight, water it often and use well-draining soil so it doesn't become too dense after a few waterings.",
      "Boost the Monstera Peru growth by using a <a href='https://shrsl.com/308ca' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>totem pole</a> or letting it climb to a surface so it can get bigger and healthier like it does in nature.

    "lightExplanation": [
      "Monstera Peru grows fast and healthy in bright but indirect light. A recommended space to put your monstera is next to a north-facing window, in a filterer window that is not facing north, or if you don't want to filter the light, place it a few feet inside so the sun in the afternoon doesn't hit its leaves.",
      "Monsteras can tolerate between 30 minutes and a couple of hours of the direct morning sun. This means you don't have to be scared of the sun hitting its leaves, but I wouldn't recommend it because you will have to give it more attention because since you have to keep the soil moist at all cost.",
      "Monstera Peru survives in low light conditions but it doesn't grow much, but remember that low-light doesn't mean without light. You can also make your monstera grow fast by providing a <a href='https://shrsl.com/308d4'target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>growing light for plants</a>."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Water you monstera Karstenianum every time the top inch of the soil is dry. The amount of water depends on how much light it receives, the temperature, the material of the pot, and soil composition. If you find difficult to know when your plant needs to be watered, you can use a <a href='https://shrsl.com/3030t'target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>soil moisture indicator</a>. It will tell you instantly if the plant needs water or not while you get used to the frequency of the watering.",
      "If you placed your monstera in bright light but indirect light, and it's not too hot, you'll find yourself watering your monstera about once or twice a week. Make sure you're using a well-draining soil so it doesn't get too compact after watering a few times.",
      "The frequency of watering depends on the material of the pot. If you are using a pot made with a porous material, you will water the plant more often because it absorbs moisture and therefore, the substrate dries faster.",
      "On the other hand, if you planted your monstera in a plastic pot, you will have to water it less because the substrate remains more humid. When using a plastic pot, there is a greater danger of overwatering your plant and therefore killing it."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Monsteras are tropical plants that love humid places even though they do fine in average room humidity. You can tell if the humidity is not enough because the leaves tend to turn yellow and end up dying.",
      "If you watn tour monstera to live in the best of conditions, use a <a href='https://shrsl.com/308fv' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>humidifier</a> to increase the humidity of the environment.",
      "One of the best spots for your monstera are bathrooms because it is a place that tends to be humid most of the day."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "Fertilize your Monstera Peru during the growing season but don't do it during winter.",
      "A slow-release granular fertilizer is recommended. Find one which is a balanced NPK with a good level of magnesium in it. Itâ€™s preferable to use one with organic nitrogen sources as those are more easily used by the plant."

    "tips": [
      "You must use well-draining soil.",
      "Place your monstera peru in the bathroom because it's a room with high humidity.",
      "Don't provide more than 1-2 hours of direct morning sun.",
      "Use a totem to make your Monstera Peru climb.",

      "Monstera Pinnatipartita is a rare evergreen and beautiful climbing plant originally from South America that looks similar to Monstera Deliciosa. It has divided leaves when it matures and produces white waxy flowers that along with its aerial roots, make it look wildly.",
      "Monstera Pinnatipartita must not be placed in the direct sun for a long period because it will burn its leaves. Also, be mindful when getting a monstera home because they are mildly toxic if ingested, meaning that you should take precautions if you have pets or children.  I've never had a bad experience with my pets myself because they have an instinct, but I always try to see how they react the first days after adding this plant to my collection.",
      "It is so recommended to use totems or to place it in a spot where it can trail to maximize its growth. As a houseplant it doesn't grow much compared to taking it outside, where it can take a whole big corner.It is so recommended to use totems or to place monsteras in a spot where they can trail to maximize its growth.

      "Pilea Peperomioides is an easy plant native to Yunnan, a region of China. It has become very famous on Instagram and Pinterest for its minimal and elegant look that helps to decorate any room.",
      "Pilea Peperomioides is also known by the name of the Chinese Money Plant because of its rounded shape that reminds us of a coin. It has some thick green leaves with a little point in the center that is where the stem joins. In nature, it grows in the shade of taller vegetation and is never in direct sunlight. Its leaves are directed towards the light in an abrupt way and although in nature the light comes from above and that is why it is usually round in shape, in our houses that is not always the case. Therefore, it is advisable to rotate it so that it adopts that symmetrical shape that we like so much.",
      "A lot of people like to propagate this plant because it's a fast grower. Pilea Peperomioides is safe for cats, dogs, babies, and other pets, so you will not have to worry about safety anymore."

    "fertilizer": "low",
    "lightExplanation": [
      "Pilea Peperomioides is a plant that loves bright and indirect light like almost all indoor plants, and cannot get direct sunlight, because it burns the leaves. A good spot for your Chinese Money Plant are east, south, and/or east-facing windows if you make sure to filter the light, or place your it a few feet inside to avoid direct sunlight.",
      "This plant tends to move towards the light excessively and that is why, if we want a vertical and / or symmetrical growth, you should rotate the plant periodically to avoid that.",
      "The Friendship Plant can grow perfectly in moderate or ambient light conditions but its growth will be affected as well as its shape since the stems will be lengthened to seek more exposure to light."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Pilea Peperoimoides reminds me of a semi-succulent plant because both its stem and its leaves are thick and allow it to retain water more easily compared to other plants. So, it's not good to overwater this plant because it will rot easily. You can tell when your pilea needs to be watered because it will have a droopy look.",
      "The ideal time to water Pilea Peperoimoides is when the soil is completely dry and it depends on the temperature, how much light the plant receives, and even the material of the pot. Usually, you will see yourself watering your Pilea Peperoimoides more or less every two weeks approximately. Let the water soak the soil completely and wait until it stops draining through the pot hole.",
      "If the plant looks droopy but the soil is completely dry, it means that it needs to be watered, on the contrary, if it shows drooping but the substrate is wet, it means that we have overgrown the water."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Most homes and workplaces will have a decent level of humidity and it's not likely something you need to be thinking about unless where you live has a pretty dry environment. However, your Chinese Money Plant will struggle in excessively humid locations. ",
      "This isn't the ideal houseplant for dank bathrooms or kitchens."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "Pilea Peperomioides doesn't need much fertilizer to keep having new growths, but it's always good to give an extra boost of food to keep working as expected. Do it biweekly or once a month using a standard houseplant or cacti based fertilizer."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "The flat, round leaves can accumulate dust so give your plant friend a regular shower or at least wipe down the leaves.",
      "Rotate the plant to get a simetric shape and make it grow straight.",
      "Avoid direct sunlight.",
      "If you want to control the shape of the plant, rotate on a regular basis, and use pruners or scissors with a sharp blade.",
      "Feed plants monthly during the spring and summer growing seasons with an all-purpose plant fertilizer."

      "Sansevieria Laurentii is the most sold variety of Sansevieria, native to Africa, and well-known for being one of the lowest maintenance and easiest plants on earth that makes it a perfect plant for beginners or for people who travels a lot.",
      "Sansevieria Trifasciata Laurentii can grow up to 1.2 meters and it's recognizable by its tight clump of dark green leaves with lighter gray-green zig-zag and yellow stripes along the margins.",
      "Snake plants are succulents air purifiers, it means they are plants that improve the air quality by removing toxins from the air. Before having a sansevieria, make sure your cat, dog or children don't eat it because it's toxic if ingested."

    "lightExplanation": [
      "Sansevieria Trifasciata Laurentii tolerates a wide range of light - from low to high light levels, but it will be happier in bright light. When snake plants are placed in low light conditions you can't expect them to grow much, but if they do, it will be slower.",
      "Sansevierias will love to receive direct sunlight for an hour or two, but they will request more water. Most of the sansevieria varieties and Sansevieria Laurentii are office plants because they can grow in artificial light."
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "Snake plants are low maintenance plants, so you won't have to do much to make them grow fast. In addition, sansevierias are drought-tolerant plants so you better be careful when watering it or you might kill them.",
      "Like other snake plant varieties, Sansevieria Trifasciata Laurentii is a succulent so it's sensitive to water. Where they are originally from, doesn't rain much, so they have developed the capacity to store water in their leaves to survive long periods without water. As you can imagine, to water it too often would be disastrous.",
      "Reduce the watering during winter. It's important to know that the amount of water is directly related to how much light a plant receives and how well-draining is the soil."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "Sansevierias don't mind the dry air in our homes and offices. They'll also do well in bathrooms where the humidity might be much higher. Its versatility is one of the reasons for being considered a hardy plant."
    ],
    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "An organic all-purpose houseplant food would be fine. Just be sure to fertilize in the spring and/or summer, twice at the most."
    ],
    "tips": [
      "Sansevierias are good plants for travelers and beginners",

      "For a high leaf color contrast, place it in a bright spot.",
      "An hour of direct sun will boost the growth. Remember to water it more often then.",
      "Use a pot that has good drainage, such as a terracotta pot or one made with some porous material."

      "Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus is commonly confused with Scindapsus Pictus Exotica because they both have silver patterns on their leaves. You can identify Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus because its leaf has a higher color contrast because its variegation appears more sparse (green with silver spots) and Scindapsus Pictus Exotica's leaf curl at the edges and is completely silver except for the central part."

      "Even though pothos aren't drought tolerant plants, they are not so picky plants when it comes to watering which makes them good plants for beginners. Water your Scindapsus Pictus Argyraeus every time the top inch of the soil is dry which will be about once a week.",

      "You should reduce the frequency of watering during winter because sunlight is lighter which means that plants receive less light so their photosynthesis is slowed down. This means the water will remain longer in the soil and can cause over-watering and root-rot"

      "Fertilize your Scindapsus Pictus every 2 weeks during the growing season to maximize its growth, but it's not necessary because it's a fast growing plant.",

    "description": [
      "Senecio Rowleyanus are succulent plants native to Africa with a beautiful look. String of Pearls is a drought-tolerant plant that stores water in its rounded leaves that reminds us of small pearls making it sensitive to water, so avoid overwatering it.",
      "Despite its delicate appearance, this unusual succulent plant is a vigorous grower, crawling quickly across the surface of the pot and then cascading down the side. Its stems can reach 60-90 cm.",
      "String of Pearls is generally used as a hanging plant. If so, it is important to make sure that the light reaches the top of the plant and not just the bottom, or it will rot."

    "lightExplanation": [
      "Senecio Rowleyanus is a succulent plant that grows fast and healthy in bright conditions and does well if the sun hits the plant directly only a bit. The best light conditions for a Senecio Rowleyanus are the ones similar to the outdoor's shade.",
      "One of the best indoor places for a string of pearls is next to a north or east-facing window, because it will receive morning sun and bright light.",
      "If you have a south or west-facing window, you should filter the light or place it a bit far from the window because the afternoon sun will burn it out.",
      "Independently where you place it, make sure the light hits the top of your String of Pearls"
    ],
    "waterExplanation": [
      "String of Pearls is a plant native to Africa, so we must replicate its natural habitat as much as possible. Native African plants are drought tolerant, so they have learned to hold water for long periods of time until they receive a large amount of water again, and this plant is no exception.",
      "The String of Pearls does not like to be watered frequently. In fact, it is easy to suffocate this plant in soggy soil because its roots are thin. Instead, they like to receive a large amount of water every two weeks or so, depending on the temperature, the substrate, and the amount of light it receives.",
      "I personally recommend a well-drained mix along with a terracotta pot to make sure we are providing the right environment."
    ],
    "humidityExplanation": [
      "String of Pearls also known as bowl of pearls does well in average room humidity.",
      "The drier the environment, the more frequently you'll water this plant. And the more humid is the environment, the less frequently you'll give it water."

    "fertilizerExplanation": [
      "Apply a slow release fertilizer once a month during the growing season otherwise its easy to burn the roots."

Not so recommended though, for people that have cats, dogs, and children because is mildly toxic if ingested, so make sure to either supervise them or place your Peace Lily far from them.",

      "On the other hand, if your Peace Lily is placed in a bright light environment or a east, south or west/facing window, you might end up watering twice per week depending on how good the soil drains the water.",

      "Peace Lily doesn't need fertilization in order to thrive well, as far as you repot it once every year or two in order to give to it new nutrients with the new soil. Both things will provide your Peace Lily with macro and micronutrients that will improve their growth and blooming.",

      "Zamioculca Zamiifolia Raven was born in the summer of 2017. It is a succulent plant that has attractive dark glossy foliage due to its high concentration of chlorophyll. In fact, is one of the few plants that its leaves are almost black.",
      "Given its waxy leaves that look artificial and the large rhizome that reminds us of a potato, zamioculcas can store water giving them the capacity to survive for long periods of time without water. This makes ZZ plant one of the best drought-tolerant plants on earth. In addition, having the ability to retain water, makes it a sensitive plant, as it is easy for its roots to rot."

That is why many people use them as office plants and everyone should have one at home. In addition, it is a purifying plant so it helps keep environments in a healthy state.",

      "Zamioculca zamiifolia prefers bright, indirect light and does well in a bit of direct, non-intense sunlight such as the early morning sun for about an hour. The ZZ plant, like any other plant, has a slower metabolism in low light conditions and therefore grows more slowly.",

      "Watering is directly related to how much light the plant needs, the soil, and the temperature, so watering will be different in summer than winter.",
